  2- Rename it to "test.png";
  3- Run the sketch;
  4- Click on any point of your image to determine your "cut" point of origin;
  5- Click again where you want to "paste" your cut and drag to the size of your choice;
  6- If you want to keep it, press the UP ARRROW and repeat the "cut,paste" process - If you want to do it again, just repeat the process
